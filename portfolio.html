	     <p>I worked with Cade and Maan.Our project was titled, "Turtle Spangled Banner. 
	      We focused on using while loops and for loops. The flag portion is created by using
	      3 while loops. After we printed 50 turtles onto the screen. We put the turtles in a 
	      infinte while loop. We created a back story which was the students passing a note.
	      From this back story we created a very "childish" background. We had weeds and a sun! At the end,
	      we created a american flag but instead of stars, turtles. We also added a ton of little background things 
              to enhance the image </p>
