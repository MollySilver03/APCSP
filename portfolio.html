	     <p>I worked with Cade and Maan.Our project was titled, "Turtle Spangled Banner. 
	      We focused on using while loops and for loops. The flag portion is created by using
	      3 while loops. After we printed 50 turtles onto the screen. We put the turtles in a 
	      infinte while loop. We created a back story which was the students passing a note.
	      From this back story we created a very "childish" background. We had weeds and a sun! At the end,
	      we created a american flag but instead of stars, turtles. We also added a ton of little background things 
              to enhance the image </p>

		 <p> I worked with Jewel, Carter, and Jeffery on the 1.2 project! We decided to do a concept that
		 includes hangman but brings a more visual apporach to it. We decided with a game called Mouse and Chesse.
	         Everytime you guessed the letter correctly the mouse would move closer to the chesse. If the player gets 
		 the letter wrong the amount of guesses would go down. When the word is guessed corrctly the mouse will eat the chesse.
	         Something really cool to me about our final project was the letter you guessed corrctly showed up on the screen.
		 The words we picked were things like phyton and turtle.

		 <p>       I worked with Katie,Maan and Alec to create a version of the game Flappy Bird. We allowed the user to move
			 the bird with the keys on the keyboard. The point of the game is move the bird through the pipes.
			 By doing this you get a score for every pipe you go through. At the end a leaderboard is displayed with the 
			 high score and the players score. The pipes randomly generate in height onto the screen. When the bird
			 hits the pipes (collison) the bird falls and that is the end of the game.

			 <p>  I worked with Carter, Jonathan, and Marian. We created a super mario platform game. We included music and allowed the user to control mario. The user goes through different levels we created. 
				Our story is that mario needed to go to the bathroom so at the ned at each level there is a toliet mario touches to switch to a new level.
