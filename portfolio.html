      <h1> The first project we did was 1.1.9 final project</h1>
	  <h1>I worked with Cade and Maan.Our project was titled, "Turtle Spangled Banner. 
	      We focused on using while loops and for loops. The flag portion is created by using
	      3 while loops. After we printed 50 turtles onto the screen. We put thre turles in a 
	      infinte while loop. We created a back story which was the students passing a note.
	      From this back story we created a very "childish" background. We had weeds and a sun.Overall,
	      the project was a ton of fun to make!</h1>
